# STM32Cube_MCU_Overall_Offer

## Overview

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio (MCU and MPU). It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform, delivered for each STM32 series.
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers : an abstraction drivers layer, the API ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio
   * The BSP Drivers of each evaluation or demonstration board provided by this STM32 series
   * A consistent set of middlewares components such as RTOS, USB, FatFS, Graphics, TCP/IP, BLE, STM32_TouchSensing_Library ...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications or demonstrations) for each board provided by this STM32 series

GitHub is a new publication model for the STM32Cube MCU embedded software. Three models of publication are proposed:
   * The **MCU Package** : monolithic STM32Cube software modules, per STM32 MCU series (Drivers, Middlewares, Utilities, Examples Projects) in an unique repo. The usual name of a STM32MCU Package is **STM32Cubexx**, xx corresponding to the STM32 series). Please refer to the chapter **STM32Cube MCU Packages** below.

   * The **MCU components** : parts of the MCU Packages, proposed as individual repos, allowing the user to select and get only the required software functions. Please refer to the chapter **STM32Cube MCU Components** below.

   * The **X-CUBE** : Expansion softwares, propose embedded software components that complement the functionalities of the STM32Cube 
   
   * A set of **MCU Utilities** : Various Utility features proposed in dedicated repos
   
Please note that a MPU offer is also proposed for the **STM32 MPU Products**. You can refer to the repo [STM32MPU_EmbSW_Overall_Offer](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32MPU_EmbSW_Overall_Offer)


## Description

This repo is a simple Readme describing all STM32 MCU related GitHub projects, the overall offer for the STM32 MCU products.

This new publication channel of the STM32Cube embedded software components will provide new added values :
   * In complement to the MCU Package zip files today proposed on **st.com**, the capability for STM32 customers to get a configuration management based delivery (Git)
   * A more direct communication between developers, thanks to the Issues features. **Caution** : only software related questions will be taken into account. Any other subject must be submitted to the [ST Community](https://community.st.com/stm32mcu) forum
   * Thanks to the deployment of a Contributor License Agreement feature (please refer to each repo CONTRIBUTING guide), the **Pull-Request** permits also to take into account customers proposed updates and enrich the STM32Cube FW offer.


For general communication and support, you can use
   * [ST Support Center](https://my.st.com/ols#/ols/) for any defect
   * [ST Community Forum](https://community.st.com/stm32mcu) forum

#### STM32Cube HAL Drivers

The **HAL Drivers** MCU Components propose the HAL and LL Drivers modules controlling all the HW IPs embedded in the STM32 product

* HAL Drivers:
  * A set of portable abstraction APIs offering high level services, built around standalone processes. The HAL drivers are functionalities oriented, example: for the Timer peripheral, the APIs could be split into several categories following the functions offered by the IPs (Basic timer, capture, PWM â€¦etc.) for a communication IP: an initialisation function, eventually a configuration function and data transfer services (polling, interruption or DMA based)
  * The compatibility SHALL be guaranteed across all the STM32 families for the generic APIs, including generic macros and common structures defines. Any specific feature is given in a dedicated extension model available in the associated extension files

* LL Drivers:
  * Low Layer Drivers: a set of basic functions with direct hardware access (no standalone process), this layer can be called either by applications or by the HAL drivers.

HAL and LL Drivers are provided in the same module/repo

The dynamic usage of HAL APIs is provided thru projects examples, available in the respective STM32Cube MCU Packages **STM32Cubexx** where xx correspond to the series
